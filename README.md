### DevOps is to software development what the assembly line is to automobile manufacturing. And, it is the logistics to get software to end users like delivery logistics get vehicles to dealers. 

#### What does this mean for your organization? If you setup a secure, efficient, robust, resilient assembly line you will innovate faster than your competition!
